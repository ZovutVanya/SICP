As a large system with generic operations evolves, new types of data objects or new operations may be needed. For each of the three strategies—generic operations with explicit dispatch, data-directed style, and message-passing-style—describe the changes that must be made to a system in order to add new types or new operations.
1. Explicit dispatch
  You have to create new procedures for the use in constructors, selectors with distinct names, type tags and type checks. Also you need to
  modify the existing procedures to acknowledge the new type

2. Data-Directed
  You need to create new procedures and add them to the table with an appropriate type tag and link them to a procedure

3. Message Passing
  You create a constructor that dispatches on a needed operation

Which organization would be most appropriate for a system in which new types must often be added? 
  Message passing

Which would be most appropriate for a system in which new operations must often be added?
  Data-Directed
